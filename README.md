# Dynamic Routing (OSPF)

This repository contains a **Cisco Packet Tracer lab** demonstrating **Dynamic Routing** using the **Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)** protocol.  
It showcases how OSPF enables efficient, scalable, and hierarchical routing between multiple routers in a network.

## üìÇ Files
- `DynamicRouting_OSPF.pkt` ‚Äì Packet Tracer lab file  
- Any supporting notes or topology diagrams  

---

## üöÄ Features
- Configuration of OSPF on multiple routers  
- Automatic exchange of routing information  
- Support for multiple areas and hierarchical design  
- Testing connectivity with `ping` and verifying routes with `show ip route`
